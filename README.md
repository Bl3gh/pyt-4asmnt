# NFT-search_with_Flask_With_Autorization

##### A web application written in python and flask to search for NFT images by their address. It saves all NFTs in postgresql database.    

* ___P.S. I have set the default settings for postgres. If you have different    settings, open the base.py file in any text editor and change the settings to your own.___
